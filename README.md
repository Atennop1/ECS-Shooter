## About project

This is my second project to learn ECS in Unity. I started it already with a small amount of knowledge, but it was still not enough. The project is a third-person shooter with an advanced character. The project implemented a lot of features for the character, but in essence, apart from the character and a small interaction system, there is nothing in the game :p

### Specifics
- Project using **ECS**
- Root was made in **OOP** style, without component providers
- Much physics stuff for the character

### Plugins and Tools
- Odin
- TMP
- UniTask
- Zenject
- Morpeh

## Conclusion

This project made a huge contribution to my learning because it helped me understand the concept of ECS and DOD better, without limiting my thinking to just OOP. It was also interesting to make your own character, because you had to create your own functionality for him from scratch (not counting the very basic physics functionality from CharacterController)
